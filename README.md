# metro-solarized

This is a modified version of the Metro Steam skin found here: http://boneyardbrew.deviantart.com/art/Metro-for-Steam-3-9-3-292419787 among other places.

I don't take credit for the original work and only really changed the gray to match better with the Numix Solarized GTK theme for Linux. 

Feel free to use this, modify it, hack it up, whatever.

One thing to note: The fonts don't look the best on a 1366 x 768 monitor.
